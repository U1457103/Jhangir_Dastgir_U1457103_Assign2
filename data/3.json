	"lyrics":"Uh hit em with a little ghetto gospel Those who wish to follow me My ghetto gospel I welcome with my hands And the red sun sinks at last Into the hills of gold And peace to this young warrior Without the sound of guns If I could recollect before my hood days I sit and reminisce Thinking of bliss and the good days I stop and stare at the younger My heart goes to em They tested with stress that they under And nowadays things change Everyones ashamed of the youth cause the truth look strange And for me its reversed We left em a world thats cursed And it hurts Cause any day theyll push the button And all come in like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothing Dont it make you get teary The world looks dreary When you wipe your eyes see it clearly Theres no need for you to fear me If you take your time and hear me Maybe you can learn to cheer me It aint about black or white cause we human I hope we see the light before its ruined my ghetto gospel Those who wish to follow me My ghetto gospel I welcome with my hands And the red sun sinks at last Into the hills of gold And peace to this young warrior Without the sound of guns Tell me do you see that old lady Aint it sad Living out of bags Plus shes glad for the little things she has And over there theres a lady Crack got her crazy Guess whos giving birth to a baby I dont trip or let it fade me From out of the fryin pan We jump into another form of slavery Even now I get discouraged Wonder if they take it all back Will I still keep the courage I refuse to be a role model"
